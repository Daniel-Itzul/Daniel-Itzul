Currently, I'm the lead developer of the Khronus Protocol. A protocol that aims to simplify the management of time in blockchain and smart contracts.  Also, I'm a web3 developer and instructor for Moralis Web3.  I'm a firm believer in the power of decentralization and in the fact that web3 is the future. 

I also have deep interest in the interoperability of private and public blockchains.
